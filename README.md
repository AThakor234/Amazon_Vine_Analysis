# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

  Analysis on Amazon reviews using PySpark and AWS and PostgreSQL
  
# Overview

  In this project, I used Amazon review datasets. Analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that   allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. I was able to use PySpark to extract,transform, and load(ETL) the data to a AWS RDS I         created and connected to my PostgreSQL.
