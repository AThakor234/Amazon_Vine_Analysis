# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

  Analysis on Amazon reviews using PySpark and AWS and PostgreSQL
  
# Overview

  In this project, I used Amazon review datasets. Analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service       that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. I was able to use PySpark to extract,transform, and load(ETL) the data to a AWS         RDS I created and connected to my PostgreSQL.

# Summary

  As we can see that, there were not many helpfu; reviews that made part of it, and only 0.72% of them rated 5-star ratings. With unpaid reviews, 99.72% were rated       with 5-star ratings.
  This allows us to conclude that customers don't feel a positivity bias for leaving good reviews in the paid program as there are so few and not so many well-rated.
